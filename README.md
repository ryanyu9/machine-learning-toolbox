# machine-learning-toolbox
This repo includes some useful functions for machine learning projects.

<b>explore_data.py</b>: include funcs exploring the data.<br>
<b>entropy_mutual_information.py</b>: include funcs calculating entropy, conditional entropy, mutual information and joint mutual information.<br>
<b>feature_selection.py</b>: include funcs to select a subset of features. The current func is based on maximum joint mutual information.<br>
<b>linear_grad.py</b>: calculate gradient and use BFGS method to solve ridge regression.<br>
<b>linear_hess.py</b>: calculate gradient and hessian matrix and use Newton-Conjugate-Gradient method to solve ridge regression.<br>
<b>logit_grad.py</b>: calculate gradient and use BFGS method to solve logistic regression with regularization.<br>
<b>logit_hess.py</b>: calculate gradient and hessian matrix and use Newton-Conjugate-Gradient method to solve logistic regression with regularization.<br>

I'll keep adding more funcs.
